Employee Self-Service

1. View and Edit Employee Information
The Employee Self Service Portal simplifies the process of physical data entry for HR staff and speeds up their processes. Employees edit their personal details on their employee profiles which are synchronized with the  Payroll system. These details include phone numbers, physical addresses, email addresses, bank information, profile picture, NSSF, and NHIF information. The HR team can access this information without having to manually feed the system with the information themselves. This allows them to concentrate on more demanding tasks that need their attention.

2. Leave Management
Leave management is a complex process for HR staff with a lot of request forms and long approval processes. Volks’s Employee Self Service Portal allows employees to use their web portal to apply for leaves. Line managers use the portal to approve leaves as soon as they receive them.  Also, employees can view their leave balances.

3. Salary Advance Management
Employees can apply for salary advance using Volks’s ESS. Using the web app, the employees can submit a salary advance request and the operations manager gets a notification of the advance request for approval or disapproval.

4. Petty Cash Management
Employees use their portal to apply for petty cash for the extra expenses they have incurred in the office.  Both the office admin and the operation manager receive a notification for certification and approval.

5. View and download payslips
Volks’s Employee Self Service Portal allows employees to view, download, and email their payslips directly from the website. Above all, they can also access their NSSF, NHIF, and PAYE deductions including other company-based deductions such as welfare deductions.

6. View and Upload Documents
Employees can easily upload their vital documents, for instance, their KRA PIN, CV, National ID, and relevant certificates using the web portal. This eliminates the struggle of keeping the physical files of an employee in an organization. Similarly, it prevents the loss of critical documents.

7. Time Management
Employees can use Volks’s Employee Service portal to check-in and check-out using QR codes as checkpoints. The QR code helps in time management because of its geo-location capabilities that ensure employees clock in and out at the right location. Even more, you can access the attendance reports in real-time.
